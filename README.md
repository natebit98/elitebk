# Project 3

RAG chat web app with own documents, organized reports, and data sheets with DRF on the backend and a React frontend.

## Setup
1. cd into /backend and `pip install -r requirements.txt`
Any time you add a dependency, add the library name to that file.

2. cd back and then into /frontend and `npm install`

3. Get .env keys from someone or something

## Tech
Frontend (/frontend): TypeScript, React
Backend (/backend): Django Rest Framework 
RAG (also /backend): LangChain and Supabase (with the psycog2-binary library so we can still use Django models.py)

## !! Need to decide AI providers we want to use
We'll likely do multiple different AI providers cause of free tier limitations. Groq and Gemini looking like frontrunners right now.
Also, we'll prolly use Tailwind, but we don't have to.

## Architecture (had some help creating this diagram)
```

```

## Methodology
Definitely use AI here as a peer throughout development cause the repo is looking quite complex right now. Especially use for frontend or UI, or if you need help with React / TypeScript or DRF.
It was going to be this complex regardless unfortunately.
