# Project 3

## Setup
1. cd into /backend and `pip install -r requirements.txt`
Any time you add a dependency, add the library name to that file.

2. cd back and then into /frontend and `npm install`

3. Get .env keys from someone or something

## Tech
Frontend (/frontend): TypeScript, React
Backend (/backend): Django Rest Framework 
RAG (also /backend): LangChain and Supabase (with the psycog2-binary library so we can still use Django models.py)

## !! Need to decide AI providers we want to use
We'll likely do multiple different AI providers cause of free tier limitations. Groq and Gemini looking like frontrunners right now.

## Architecture (had some help creating this diagram)

## Methodology
Definitely use AI here as a peer throughout development cause the repo is looking quite complex right now. Especially use for frontend or UI, or if you need help with React / TypeScript or DRF.
It was going to be this complex regardless unfortunately.
